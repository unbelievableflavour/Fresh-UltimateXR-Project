# Fresh UltimateXR Project

This project utilizes the UltimateXR framework in a Unity project to start developing your application faster and without hassle.

## UltimateXR

[UltimateXR](https://www.ultimatexr.io/) is a free, open source framework and toolkit for Unity that includes powerful features such as cross-device compatibility, state-of-the-art grab and manipulation mechanics, inclusion through a library of gender- and race-agnostic hands, customizable full body avatar representation, advanced UI components, locomotion mechanics, and much more.

## How to get the samples?

1. Go to `window > package manager > UltimateXR > Samples`.
2. Press `import` on `full scene`.

You will now a have a scene full of samples to play with! The folder is mobile optimized and will run fine on Quest.
